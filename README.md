# README for Stats-254-Week1
This is the first problem set for [Stanford Psych 254](http://web.stanford.edu/class/psych254/). My name is *Rhia Catapano*, and I am a student in Behavioral Marketing at Stanford GSB. I work primarily in RStudio, so the document that I have added to my repository is an .rmd (and the corresponding .html). 

##Assignment Goals
The main goal of this assignment were:
* to gain a working understanding of git and github.
* to be able to use github for version control by pushing updates and viewing version histories.

##Implementation
I originally used the terminal, but found that although the desktop has a big learning curve, its significantly more intuitive for non-power users.

##Function
The .rmd file in the project currently does not have any functionality to document.

##Collaborators
I worked on the original assignment with Katherine in the terminal, but ended up redoing the assignment from the Desktop App because I felt like I still didn't really understand what I was doing using the terminal.
